<br><br>Sheep are domestic animals typically kept as livestock and raised for their wool,  meat, and milk, and  are occasionally used as model organisms in science. With over one billion domestic sheep in the world, they are the most numerous type of sheep, others being mountain sheep, snow sheep, and bighorn sheep, all of which are non-domestic sheep. An adult female is called a ewe, an adult male is called a ram, tup or wether, and juvenile sheep are called lambs.
